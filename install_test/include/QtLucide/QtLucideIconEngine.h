/**
 * @brief Custom QIconEngine implementation for efficient Lucide icon rendering
 * @details QtLucideIconEngine implements Qt's QIconEngine interface to provide
 *          high-performance, cached rendering of Lucide icons. It integrates
 *          seamlessly with Qt's icon system while providing advanced features
 *          like custom painters, extensive caching, and state-aware rendering.
 *
 *          Key features:
 *          - Efficient pixmap caching with automatic cache key generation
 *          - Support for all Qt icon modes and states
 *          - Integration with QtLucideIconPainter system
 *          - Proper handling of high-DPI displays
 *          - Thread-safe rendering operations
 *
 * @par Caching Strategy:
 * The engine maintains an internal cache of rendered pixmaps keyed by size,
 * mode, and state. This ensures that identical icon requests are served
 * from cache, providing excellent performance for applications with many
 * icon instances.
 *
 * @par Integration with Qt:
 * This engine is automatically used when creating QIcon instances through
 * QtLucide methods. It provides full compatibility with Qt's icon system
 * including support for:
 * - QIcon::Mode (Normal, Disabled, Active, Selected)
 * - QIcon::State (On, Off)
 * - Multiple icon sizes with automatic scaling
 * - High-DPI rendering
 *
 * @note This class is typically not used directly by application code
 * @note The engine maintains references to QtLucide and painter instances
 *
 * @see QtLucide::icon(), QtLucideIconPainter, QIconEngine
 * @ingroup QtLucideCore
 * @since 1.0
