# Doxygen and Public API Docs

- Public headers are under [`include/QtLucide/`](mdc:include/QtLucide). Document public classes, methods, enums, and free functions with Doxygen-style comments.
- Keep docs concise and accurate; prefer explaining rationale or non-obvious behavior over restating names.
- Reference relevant docs in [`docs/api`](mdc:docs/api) and ensure examples compile against the public API.
- Do not document generated headers directly; instead document the generators and usage:
  - Generated: [`include/QtLucide/QtLucideEnums.h`](mdc:include/QtLucide/QtLucideEnums.h), [`include/QtLucide/QtLucideStrings.h`](mdc:include/QtLucide/QtLucideStrings.h)
  - Generators: [`tools/generate_headers.py`](mdc:tools/generate_headers.py)
