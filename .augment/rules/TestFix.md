Run all tests in the QtLucide project and fix any issues that are encountered during test execution. Please follow these steps:

1. First, identify the testing framework and test structure used in the project by examining the codebase
2. Locate all test files and understand how tests are organized
3. Run the complete test suite using the appropriate test runner/command
4. Analyze any test failures, errors, or warnings that occur
5. For each issue found:
   - Investigate the root cause by examining the failing test and related code
   - Implement the necessary fixes in the source code or test files
   - Ensure fixes don't break other functionality
6. Re-run tests after each fix to verify the issue is resolved
7. Continue this process until all tests pass successfully
8. Provide a summary of what issues were found and how they were resolved

If you encounter any ambiguities about which tests to run or how to run them, please ask for clarification before proceeding.
